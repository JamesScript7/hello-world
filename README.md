# hello-world
My first repository

Hey you,

I want to learn front-end Web Development but specialize in JavaScript! In time, I would love to
learn back-end programming so I can expand my limits and be a full stack developer. I love cats
and I love learning new things. Can you imagine that, in our lifetime, software engineers and developers
might be just as valuable as doctors if they already are not. I'm talking about saving lives and
making this world a better place. I want to have an important role for shaping the future.

That's pretty much it, talk to you later!
James Kim
